Everything in life you must earn. There is no quick fix, no easy pill and\nno cheating it. There is no such thing as genetics always wins. Hard work\nwins every single time. The higher the risk the higher the rewards. It\nmeans that if you work your ass off for anything in life, it means so much\nmore to you than if it was given. Take a child for example. Parents can buy\ntheir kids anything and that kid, for the most part, won\'t take as good\ncare of it as if he had to buy it. It comes with working out. You work hard\nand you know you put everything you had into your training. You cherish\nthat and you strive to be better than yesterday.
