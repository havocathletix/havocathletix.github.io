I will be back. I will be back stronger mentally, physically and emotionally. I will try and exceed the expectations I give to those around me. I will not lose perspective on what I love. I will not fall into anybody else's negative bullshit attitude. This is me:

Adversity does actually build character.

Hard work is actually a virtue we must all strive for.

The things that come easy are usually less of value.

Simple things to realize and to use in everyday life. It could always be worse. Love life and live it.
