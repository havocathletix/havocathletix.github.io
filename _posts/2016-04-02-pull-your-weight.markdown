title: Pull your weight
layout: post

You don't need fancy equipement to become strong and powerful. All you need is imagination and the ground beneath your feet. Today was a bunch of pulling and pushing my weight. For one thing, I love pullups. They build muscle that no other movement can live up to. People hate them because they simply cannot do them...yet. It is perhaps one of the most hated simple effective movements. And I get it, it's hard to lift yourself up. But you have to keep at it over and over. Your goal should be 1. Then after you conquer that your goal will be 2 and so on and so on. Just don't give up.
