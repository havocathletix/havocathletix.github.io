        Today was an extremely long day. And not just long and boring. Long and exhausting mentally and physically. There are taxing situations you have to get through. There is no food. Hot as hell.  I was hungry but have been worse off. Away from family and missing home. 
          And then it dawned on me. What's the point of training so hard if you don't use it? I smiled and laughed all day. Nothing can be as bad as an all out minute on the airdyne. Well some stuff but not a lot of things come before it.
Sometimes during brutal workouts, you probably won't be able to talk, but you can always crack a smile somehow someway. Life is tough sometimes but that doesn't mean you can't show some teeth. Apply what you learn about yourself in the gym to every day life. Just like doing Airdyne to Hell; eventually you will get your legs back under you and smile because you over came it. Or smile because it fucking sucked and you didn't think you were going to make it. Nothing is as bad as you think it is. Sometimes you just have to ride the way to the shallow water.
