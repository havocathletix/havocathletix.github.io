Today was a day of pain. Pain in my body and in my soul. I had to getstitches and had training until 7 tonight. Sometimes you just have to fucking do it. Here's what I did:

10 min easy row 
3x10 air squats
3x5 goblet squats
3x5 wall squats

W2H Back squat

Then:
4x3 @85% of 1RM

15x30sec row/90sec of rest
-kept a 150m pace all 15 rounds
-10x pushups during rest
