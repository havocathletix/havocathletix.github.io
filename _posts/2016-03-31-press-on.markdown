Today was a day of pain. Pain in my body and in my soul. I had to get\nstitches and had training until 7 tonight. Sometimes you just have to\nfucking do it. Here\'s what I did:\n-\n10 min easy row\n\n3x10 air squats\n3x5 goblet squats\n3x5 wall squats\n\nW2H Back squat\n\nThen:\n4x3 @85% of 1RM\n\n15x30sec row/90sec of rest\n-kept a 150m pace all 15 rounds\n-10x pushups during rest
