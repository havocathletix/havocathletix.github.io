Work hard, don't overthink, have a little fun, and above else no fucking drama. Learn to enjoy what you do. We can fall into the trap of complaining and making our own struggles with training bigger than they need to be. Not everyday is the gym is a psychological crucible. Not every day involves suffering. If you are in a place where you can get to the gym every day you aren't truly suffering. True suffering is not knowing where your next meal is coming from or dealing with a serious illness. Learn to enjoy the process in the gym more, learn to relax while working your ass off, and the results will speak for themselves. -Rob McDonald
