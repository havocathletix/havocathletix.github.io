           Mondays are great. There is nothing wrong with Mondays. You make Mondays a problem. It irks me when people say they have the Monday blues. It's the start of the week and it's a chance to continue with your goals or even make new goals. If you have kids, be a role model and let them know that you love Mondays. Not because you get to drop them off at school and not see them for 8 hours, but because you love what you do. I'm a realist and know that 75% of the people took the gym off on Sunday. That's fine but on Monday hit the ground running. Start the day off with your favorite music and coffee or juice and let people know you love Monday.
